==============================
US Traffic Accident Analysis
==============================

This script analyzes a sample dataset of US traffic accidents. It visualizes accident patterns based on time of day, accident types, and geographic distribution across states.

------------------------------
Features
------------------------------
✔ Loads a public accident dataset from an online CSV  
✔ Cleans and processes time-related data  
✔ Visualizes:
   - Accidents by hour of the day
   - Accident types (if available)
   - Top 10 states with the most accidents
✔ Reports missing values in the dataset

------------------------------
Requirements
------------------------------
Before running the script, ensure that the following Python packages are installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

To install them, open your terminal and run:

    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

------------------------------
How to Run the Script

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (or any other editor).
2. Make sure Python is installed and available in your system PATH.
3. Open the terminal and run the script:

    python code.py

------------------------------
Data Source
------------------------------
The dataset is publicly available and loaded from a GitHub Gist URL:

    https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rajkumarboddapati2/...

It contains sample traffic accident data including date, time, location, and type of accident.

------------------------------
Output
------------------------------
The script generates the following visualizations:

- Bar chart: Accidents by Hour (0–23)
- Horizontal bar chart: Accident Types (if available)
- Bar chart: Top 10 States by number of accidents (if available)

It also prints a summary of missing values (if any) to the terminal.

- If the dataset structure changes (column names differ), some plots may be skipped with a warning.
- You can customize or expand the script to include more analysis (e.g., severity, city-wise stats, etc.)
